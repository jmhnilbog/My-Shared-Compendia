## Once men, now beasts devoted to chaos!

The beastmen lurking within the keep are all villagers corrupted by the lure of the chaos gods. The transformation is both slow and torturous, inevitably driving the subject mad with pain. And while the end result is always horrific, each beastman is mutated in its own unique fashion.

While beastmen have the capacity to take orders, only the *champions* and *shamans* retain the reasoning that once distinguished them from the animal kingdom. In the place of true intelligence, they develop animal cunning, stalking their prey like a pack of wolves or a pride of lions.

In general--insofar as such a term can be used--most beastmen resemble their namesake: a hunched, feral cross between a man and a beast. The transformed beastman fights much like the man it once was. Teeth, claws, or simple or improvised weapons are used as best fit the individual's form, doing damage as a spear.

The shamans of the beastmen are much more intelligent than the others. They prioritize sacraments of chaos above the fleshly revels of the chaotic hordes.
