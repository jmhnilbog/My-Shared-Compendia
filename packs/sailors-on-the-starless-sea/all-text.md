### Area A – Devil’s Causeway

::: readaloud
An **old dirt road, now overrun with weeds and sickly vines**, rises towards the ruined citadel. A grisly sight bars your way: **a pair of bodies, secured to poles by long ropey vines**. The wicked vines have wormed their way inside the bodies’ eyes, ears, and mouths.
:::

#### Upon Closer Look:

To your horror, you realize the bodies are still moving.

#### Upon Approaching the Bodies:

The vines unwind from the posts, freeing the horrors to shamble toward the PCs.
The bodies are vine horrors: corpses animated by the foul vines growing from
seeds planted in their chests.

::: encounter creatures vine-horror
* Vine Horror (Keary, holds short sword and dagger, presents from father)
* Vine Horror (Alban, 5cp in right boot)
:::

#### If PCs Are Entangled Or the Bodies Are Scrutinized:

Villagers will recognize the vine horrors as Keary and Alban, sons of the village smith. The
brothers vanished from the village eleven days ago. The beastmen killed the
brothers and seeded their corpses with vine horrors to ward off any
investigations from the townsfolk. 

:::: aside creatures vine-horror

***Creatures: Vine Horror***

Vine horrors are rotting bodies animated by foul vines that grow from seeds planted within their chest cavities. The corpses serve both as nutritious hosts for the vines and as seed pods for future vine horrors. They attack twice a round, silently, flailing with long, ropey vines.

::: statblock
Vine Horrors (2): Init +2; Atk vine +2 melee
(1d4); AC 13; HD 2d10; hp 10 each; MV 20’; Act 2d20; SP Entangle (automatic 1d6

Entangle
: If both vines strike the same victim
in one round, they entangle the target, automatically inflicting 1d6 points of
crushing and choking damage on the following round. An entangled victim can win
free with a DC 15 Strength check.

Death Throes
: On the attack that kills a vine horror, the host
corpse splits open, spilling out thousands of small seeds slick with mucus. The
seeds become unviable in 12 hours but can move 1 foot per hour until then. If a
seed reaches a corpse before expiring, the corpse rises as a vine horror in 1d4
days.

Awkward Movement
: Vine horrors can only be mistaken for living creatures at a great distance, as they move strangely. They cannot use Action Dice for additional movement.

### Area B – Ruined Wall

::: readaloud
The keep’s **massive wall has collapsed here**, spilling cyclopean stone blocks down the rocky slope. The blocks are **precariously balanced** atop one another, like a titan’s game of dice. 
:::

:::: encounter trap

It is relatively simple work for the PCs to pick their way
up the blocks and enter the keep. Several of the blocks are poised to shift if
disturbed. Cautious PCs that choose to carefully inspect the slope can detect
and avoid the dangerous blocks. Those ascending the slope without
noting the danger inevitably trigger a slide. One false step and massive granite
blocks tumble down the slope, crushing all in their path. Clouds of choking dust
fill the air along with the screams of the dying and the deafening crash of
stone against stone. All PCs on the slope are targets

#### Unstable Heap

Those ascending the slope without noting the danger inevitably trigger a slide. One false step and massive granite blocks tumble down the slope, crushing all in their path. Clouds of choking dust fill the air along with the screams of the dying and the deafening crash of stone against stone. All PCs on the slope are targets

::: statblock 
Unstable Rubble: Atk avalanche +5 melee
(1d10); Detect DC 10 Int (Automatic DC 8 INT check for miners and dwarves, dwarves add CL); Trigger: DC 20 Str (from top); SP Destruction (all equipment of those killed is destroyed), Reveal (shaft may be discovered after avalanche).
:::

#### If the Avalanche is Triggered:

The entrance to a
long-forgotten tomb may be discovered by any character searching the rubble. A
narrow, rocky shaft descends 14 feet before opening into a small cave at the
foot of an enormous, rune-carved portal. This is area B-1. 

### Area B-1 – Tomb of the Fallen: 

#### If Approached from Above:

::: readaloud
You squeeze down through the narrow opening, dropping into the small
cave below. The air is choked with chalky dust and the pervasive smell of rot. A
single shaft of light cuts through the swirling dust to illuminate an enormous
stone door set in a portal. The portal is circumscribed in runes. At the center
of the door is a large pentagram inscribed within a circle. Both the runes and
the pentagram are set with silver and seem to glimmer faintly in the dim light.
:::

#### If Approached from the Southeast:

::: readaloud
A
strange and foreboding portal bars your way. The portal is circumscribed in
runes. At the center of the portal is a large pentagram inscribed within a
circle. Both the runes and the pentagram are set with silver and seem to glimmer
faintly in the dim light. 
:::

#### If the Runes are Read:

Wizards, their apprentices, fortune-tellers and
astrologers may attempt to decipher the runes (Intelligence, DC 12). A
successful check reveals the following phrases: 

    the burning purge, which scours the earth 
    the hardened glamour, stilling life 
    the baleful storm, heedless to supplication 
    the raging tempest, devourer from within 
    banes four I place upon this gate:
    Fire, Ice, Storm and Hate Page
    
    On a failed check, the judge is

encouraged to make up a misleading translation. 

#### Opening the Portal

Though heavy, the stone portal is not locked and can be opened with a **DC 20 Strength** check.

This triggers the first ward: a blast of flame engulfs the door, targeting any within
10 feet (Atk fire ward +0 melee; dmg 1d10). Those scrambling out of the hole
(Reflex save, DC 15) take only half damage. 

#### When the Portal Opens:

::: readaloud
As the last wisps of flame fade, you can make out a soft
crackling sound rustling in the chamber beyond. An icy chill settles over the
air and your breath condenses into misty clouds. Through the portal you can make
out a low funerary bier. A body lies in repose atop the stone. The body was once
a warrior of some sort—it wears a suit of thick hide armor and clutches an
enormous battle axe to its chest. The entire chamber sparkles with a soft, elfin
glow. 
:::

This chamber is the tomb of the warrior Felan, brother to Molan, and
fellow chaos lord. Felan was killed in battle with the forces of good and was
entombed here to prevent his corpse’s capture and desecration. The elfin glow
emanates from a hardened sheet of ice that coats the entire chamber. Though
there is no light source within the tomb, the ice refracts the sunlight from
above, bathing the entire chamber in a soft glow. As evidenced by the
characters’ breath, the chamber is preternaturally cold. 

::: aside
The cold and ice pose
three threats: 

* Characters must make a DC 12 Fortitude save for every round
spent within the chamber. Each failed save lowers the PC’s movement by 15 feet
as his body succumbs to the cold. Once a PC’s movement drops to zero, he can no
longer take any actions. 
* The floor is covered in polished, hardened ice.
Characters attempting to walk across the ice must succeed on a DC 15 Reflex save
or slip to the ground. Attempting to stand takes 1 round. The ice is slick
enough for PCs to slide. A PC can push off the bier (or get a running leap from
outside) and slide across the room. 
* After 5 rounds within the chamber, the PC
takes 1d4 points of cold damage per round. 
:::

Felan was an enormous man, nearly
seven feet tall and muscled like a bear. His hide armor is of excellent
craftsmanship, sewn from the thick hides of basilisks and the fur of polar
worms. Felan’s enormous axe is forged of meteoric iron and can only be wielded
by a character with a Strength score 16 or better. The terrible weapon inflicts
1d10 damage on a hit and inflicts critical hits on a threat range expanded by 1
(i.e., a natural roll of 19-20 for most characters, or 18-20 for a warrior or
dwarf who is already at a 19-20 crit range). Unfortunately, the corpse and its
treasures are all frozen within the ice. A DC 20 Strength check is required to
break the axe free of the corpse. (This is particularly grisly, snapping Felan’s
icy fingers in the process.) Freeing the corpse and its armor is even more
difficult, requiring two subsequent DC 23 Strength checks. Each attempt to free
the axe or corpse from the ice takes 1 round. 

::: aside curse
Heroes escaping the tomb with
either the axe or the armor are subject to two last wards: the curse of storm
and hate. Judges are encouraged to create their own curse, specific to their
home campaign. Following are some sample curses to serve as inspiration: 

* The
next time the PCs are at sea, their ship is overtaken by a fearsome storm. Just
as their ship is torn asunder, the heroes see an image of Felan, silhouetted in
the heart of the clouds. To survive the PCs must make it to a jungle island, 
where ancient reptiles lie in wait. 
* The wielder of the Axe of Felan is slowly
overcome by his passions. At the judge’s choosing (at least once per adventure)
the wielder must succeed on a DC 15 Will save or succumb to a violent rage, 
mindlessly attacking his foes and savagely pursuing them to the death. 
* The
next time the PCs are traveling through the wilderness, they are overtaken by
towering thunderclouds on an otherwise clear day. Just before the rain starts to
fall, the PCs spy the silhouette of Felan in the heart of the roiling black
clouds. Then comes the lightning. Each PC that entered the tomb is attacked by a
bolt of lightning: Atk lightning bolt +1 missile fire; dmg 2d10. 

:::

#### Area C – Gatehouse

::: readaloud
The dark, moss-eaten gatehouse towers above you, grim and forbidding.
Murder holes, fashioned in the likeness of looming toads, threaten to gout forth
flaming oil and tar. Black arrow slits pierce the high stone walls. You can hear
the flap of the heretical banner above, hidden from sight by the vine-draped
battlements. The ancient drawbridge has long since fallen away into ruin, 
leaving only a few rotting planks placed across the ditch. The heavy iron
portcullis stands half-raised, the rusty spikes a mere four feet above slots cut
into the stone floor.
:::

Two snarling beastmen lurk on the second floor of
the gatehouse (accessible only from area H). Cautious PCs pausing to listen will
hear animal-like sniffing sounds and the scratch of claws on stone coming from
above. The beastmen wait for the PCs to enter, then drop the portcullis on the
last rank (Atk portcullis -5 melee; Dmg 1d6/round). A hero pinned by the
portcullis takes ongoing damage each round until he dies or is freed (DC 23 Str
check; alternately, 4 characters lifting together can hoist the portcullis if
their combined Str exceeds 40). After dropping the portcullis, the beastmen toll
a great bell. This alerts their brothers to the PCs’ presence. Their work done, 
the howling beastmen withdraw to area H. Beastmen (2): Init +1; Atk spear +0
melee (1d6); AC 12; HD 1d8; hp 3 each; MV 30’; Act 1d20; SV Fort +1, Ref +1, 
Will -1; AL C. 

#### Area D – Courtyard

::: aside
The courtyard is overgrown with sickly weeds
and thick brambles. A deathly silence hangs in the air, as if even the frogs and
insects are afraid to draw attention to themselves. The smell of rotting
vegetation is pervasive, and the ground sucks at your boots with every tentative
step. Nearly all of the courtyard’s buildings have fallen into ruin. A single
burnt-out shell set against the keep’s east wall is the only remaining
structure. Set near the heart of the courtyard is a well, framed with a crude
pulley system. To the east is the keep’s sole standing tower. 

:::

Heroes pausing to
inspect the ground easily discover a muddy trail leading from the gatehouse
through the brambles to the south tower (area H). The small side trail runs to
the well (area F). The muddy prints indicate a wide variety of creatures: human
footprints, the tracks of large creatures with only three toes, hawk-like
talons, and perhaps even the slithering trail of an enormous snake. While
seeming to hint at a variety of monsters, all the tracks belong to mutated
beastmen. 

#### Area D-1 – Forgotten Cache

 Pulling away the dead brambles and matted
weeds, you find a long flagstone, half-buried in the muddy ground. Digging away
the rotting soil, you discover a sigil carved into the face of the flagstone.
The cache can only be found by PCs explicitly searching the courtyard. The
flagstone is actually a capstone concealing a small subterranean cist. The small
chamber was intended to conceal treasures in case the keep was abandoned to
invaders. Wizards, their apprentices and scribes can attempt a DC 12
Intelligence check to translate the rune. Properly identified, it reads: ‘Til
Death Shall Pass. If the check fails, the judge is welcome to make up a
misleading translation. Hoisting the capstone requires prodigious might
(Strength check, DC 30). Alternately, clever PCs might opt to use the block and
tackle from the well to lift the stone. Lifting the capstone reveals a small, 
coffin-like nook, walled and floored with stone. A hide-wrapped bundle, roughly
5 feet in length, sits atop a pair of wooden rests. Inside the bundle is: • A
stone idol depicting the chaos god Nimlurun. A longsword forged of milky steel sheathed
in a jewelencrusted scabbard (worth 75 gp). • A fur-tufted longbow and a leather
quiver containing 25 arrows. Age has ruined the bow: on a roll of a natural 1 or
2, the bow snaps, inflicting 1d2 points of damage to the wielder. This weakness
is immediately obvious to any hunter or forester. • A leather pouch containing a
granular green powder and a roll of five cloth bandages. When wine or water is
added to the green powder, it forms a poultice that heals 1d4+1 hp of damage.
Any healer, herbalist, shaman, or cleric can readily identify the powder, or PCs
can discover its purpose through experimentation. There is sufficient powder for
10 applications. The hide is the fur of a rare spotted mountain leopard and can
fetch up to 50 gp if sold to the right buyer. 

#### Area E – The Charnel Ruins

This
once-proud edifice has fallen into ruin like the rest of the keep. All that
remains of the building are fire-scarred high stone walls and toad-faced
gargoyles leering from above. The singed, bronze doors—cast with hundreds of
wailing demonic faces—are barred from the outside. The portal is marked with a
single word drawn in flaking red paint: REPENT. When the keep fell to the forces
of good, acolytes of the chaos god sought refuge within their chapel. Fearing to
tread on unholy ground, the invaders barred the doors from without and set fire
to the temple, burning the wicked acolytes alive. It is a simple matter to open
the portals. Heroes removing the great wooden beam can easily draw open the
bronze portals by the enormous rings held within the maws of two fiendish
demons. Inside, the PCs discover a horrific scene: Six charred skeletons lie
about the chapel, some crushed by burnt fallen beams. At the head of the chapel
is a fountain depicting a squat, demonic toad. A foul, black ichor seeps from
the toad’s broad lips, pooling in the basin seated at the foot of the fountain.
Even though the slaughter took place decades ago, the stench of charred flesh
lingers in the air along with the sour scent of freshly burnt incense. Brave PCs
that dare to test the skeletons find that the charred bones are hot to the
touch, as if the fire burned only yesterday. Cinders glow red and orange beneath
each fallen bone. A cursory inspection of the frog fountain reveals red gemstone
eyes and jeweled fangs within the loathsome maw. All together, the 12
semi-precious stones are worth 150 gp. The following items lie scattered about
the temple and skeletons: • A golden censer, hanging at the end of a long bronze
chain, blackened from the heat. The censer is worth 65 gp and can be used to
placate certain agents of Chaos (see below). • A blackened iron coffer, 
half-buried in the rubble. The coffer is locked and must be picked (DC 15 pick
locks) or smashed open (DC 12 Str). Inside are three cones of incense wrapped in
sanctified, unholy cloth stitched with golden signs of Chaos. • Three scorched
chainmail hauberks. • Three blackened maces and one flail. Retrieving any of the
gear or the gems requires entering the chapel. Those stepping inside the temple
immediately hear the crackling of cinders and feel the heat of the blackened
earth beneath their feet. Though unsettling, this poses no threat to the heroes.
Similarly, the charred skeletons offer no danger. The same cannot be said, 
however, of the black ichor dribbling from the fountain’s maw and collecting in
the fetid basin. Heroes coming within 10 feet of the basin can feel the heat
coming off of the toad-fountain. As the PCs come within 5 feet, the ooze
animates and rolls up and out of the basin, attacking the nearest PC. On the
round following a successful pseudopod attack, the tar ooze ignites, inflicting
1d4 points of fire damage and setting fire to the unlucky PC. Putting out the
fire requires 1 action and quickness on the part of the hero. (“Stop, drop and
roll!” is sufficient, but PCs whose players are unable to succinctly describe
how they put out the flaming tar burn for another round.) The tar ooze can also
be placated by swinging the charred censer, filling the fallen chapel with
incense smoke. So long as the area is suffused with smoke, the tar ooze sits
motionless, unmoving and still. There is sufficient incense in the censer to
keep the ooze still for 5 rounds. The 3 cones sealed in the coffer can also burn
for up to 5 rounds each. The censer can also be used to placate the chaos
leviathan lurking beneath the waves in area 1-4. Tar Ooze: Init (always last); 
Atk pseudopod +4 melee (1d4

* ignite for additional 1d4 on following round); AC 10; HD
  2d10; hp 10; MV 5’, climb 5’; Act 1d20; SP half damage from
  slicing and piercing weapons; SV Fort +6, Ref -8, Will -6; AL N.
  Area F – Well of Souls: A barren ridge of black stone rises from
  the overgrown courtyard. A low stone wall marked with eerie sigils
  is built atop the crest of the stone, marking a well. A stout block and
  tackle frame supports a single thick chain that plunges into the inky
  blackness. A soft moan rises from the well, like a faint cry for help.
  Though resembling a normal well, the Well of Souls is far more
  sinister. For reasons unknown even to the chaos lords, the well
  opens up into an inter-dimensional nexus, permitting access
  to the raw stuff of proto-elemental chaos. Before the keep fell
  to the forces of Law, the well was used to condition living sacrifices.
  Now the inhabitants of the keep use the well to transform
  captives into the savage, half-feral beastmen.
  Very little good can come from toying with the well, but heroes
  are nothing if not fools.
  Those daring to peer into the depths of the well see a yawning
  darkness. Depth perception and spatial reality have no relationship
  within the well; it seems to fall away from the PCs
  even as they draw closer, forcing any PC that peers into the
  depths to succeed on a DC 13 Will save or pitch over the lip
  of the well. Adjacent heroes can attempt DC 15 Reflex saves
  to catch their falling comrade; otherwise the unfortunate soul
  Page 8
  plummets down into darkness. The victim never strikes bottom; 
  instead, his mind, body, and soul dissolve into nothingness, 
  lost to the ceaseless winds of Chaos.
  A falling PC has one last chance to catch himself—a DC 15
  Reflex save to catch the chain, but the damage is already done.
  Characters entering the well are subsumed by chaos and
  emerge from the well forever changed. As the PCs descend, 
  damned souls circle about them, and the links of the chain
  grow tacky, then soft to the touch, and finally drip away like
  rivulets from a molten candle. The very being of the PC is
  flayed, with unpredictable results.
  For every round spent within the well, the PC must roll 1d16
  plus 5 plus Personality bonus, on the minor corruption table
  (see DCC RPG core rulebook), as if he had rolled a 1 on a spell
  check.
  Curiously, the well acts as both a boon and bane to wizards.
  Arcane spells cast within 50 feet of the well receive a +10 bonus
  to the caster’s spell check. However, each spell cast automatically
  incurs a corruption (rolled normally on the corruption
  table). Attempts to invoke lawful patrons within the
  well’s sphere of influence always fail.
  Area G – Sinkhole: A yawning sinkhole has devoured nearly a
  third of the courtyard, causing a tower and wall to collapse and
  plunge down into the depths. Mist billows up from the sinkhole, obscuring
  sight. Tortured faces and writhing forms appear briefly in
  the mists above your heads, only to dissolve back into nothingness as
  quickly as they appeared.
  The raw power emanating from the temple of Chaos (see area
  1-5) has undermined the ground, causing the earth to collapse.
  Approaching the edge is risky—any additional weight can
  cause the earth to give way.
  500 feet of rope? Let me check my pack!
  So there is always the chance that—by either obscene miracle or shifty recordkeeping—the PCs actually have enough
  rope for the sinkhole at area G. Never mind that carrying that much medieval rope strains credulity. Where does descending
  through the nigh-endless mists get them?
  Heroes that succeed in anchoring the rope and rappelling into the black emerge a mere 55 feet from the island (see area
  1-5), with the chaos leviathan lurking just below the surface of the inky waters. Worse, after half the party has descended
  the rope, the beastmen charge from the tower (area H) and attack the party. If the beastmen win the battle, they sever the
  rope, sealing the surviving PCs within the depths of the underworld.
  Page 9
  Heroes coming within 15 feet of the lip of the sinkhole have
  the eerie premonition that the earth is hollow beneath them, as
  if they were walking on a frozen lake. If the PCs come within
  5 feet, the earth gives way. A PC must succeed on a DC 13
  Reflex save to seize hold of the crumbling lip or plummet to
  his doom.
  A PC can pull himself up over the lip with a desperate DC
  15 Strength check. Other heroes can leap to his aid, but their
  weight causes the edge of the sinkhole to fall away, sending
  allies plummeting to their deaths and starting the cycle anew.
  Heroes can counteract the weak crust by splaying out, spread
  eagle. However, at the judge’s discretion, large PCs or those
  encumbered by heavy armor may cause the earth to give way
  regardless.
  Characters peering down into the writhing mists can see only
  30 feet before their vision is entirely obscured by the billowing
  clouds of mist rising from below. While the goal of their quest
  lies exposed, over 500 feet below, descending the sinkhole is
  almost physically impossible. Heroes can rappel down the
  side of the sinkhole, but after 45 feet it opens into the ceiling
  of the yawning cave. Without several hundred feet of rope, the
  PCs will be forced to find another route to the caverns below.
  Area H –Tower of the Beast: Flanked by crumbling stone walls, 
  the moss-covered tower stands proud despite the ravages of time. A
  tall, rust-bound portal bars the tower’s sole entrance, watched over
  by a leering demonic gargoyle. Rings of deep arrow slits pierce the
  thick walls, and overarching battlements loom high above.
  Heroes trying the tower door discover it barred from within.
  Breaking down the door requires a DC 20 Strength check. Alternately, 
  a PC armed with an axe or hammer can destroy the
  door with 5 minutes of hard labor.
  The first PCs into the tower discover a hellish scene:
  The hot stench of rot rolls from the tower, raising bile in the back of
  your throat. The floor of the wide tower is covered in rotting hides of
  cattle, sheep and men. A narrow staircase spirals around the tower
  wall. Dark forms hang from chains spiked through the wall—surely
  these are your fellow countrymen!
  A pack of snarling beast-men slowly emerges from the shadows, 
  bloody spears clutched in their gnarled hands!
  The beastmen lurk within the tower, trying to lure the PCs inside
  one at a time. An enormous beastman champion—a seven-
  foot monstrosity with the head of a feral bull— crouches
  atop the spiral staircase directly above the door, attacking the
  PCs with surprise from above.
  The beastmen fight so long as the champion lives, then do
  their best to flee the tower into the courtyard. They refuse to
  surrender but take captives if they are able. Captured PCs are
  bound in chains and hung upside-down from the arrow slits
  Page 10
  like their fellow villagers, before being subjected to the soulwarping
  energies of the Well of Souls, transforming the erstwhile
  heroes into feral beastmen.
  The beastman champion wears a large silver torc hung with
  bleached skulls. Each skull is branded with a chaos rune. By
  virtue of the craftsmanship and precious metal, the torc is
  worth 100 gp, but when donned by a chaotic or evil wizard, the
  torc grants a +1 bonus to all spell checks. Destroying the torc
  grants lawful aligned PCs a bonus of +1 XP, while earning them
  the notice (and perhaps enmity) of the gods of Chaos.
  Beastman Champion: Init +1; Atk axe +2 melee (1d6+2); AC
  12; HD 2d8; hp 8; MV 30’; Act 1d20; SV Fort +2, Ref +1, Will

  AL C.
  The tower floor and the steps spiraling up the wall are covered
  in gore-covered furs. Searching the chamber scatters waves of
  fleas and lice. Worse, there is a 1 in 6 chance that the searcher
  encounters a rot grub hidden amid the rotting hides. On a successful
  attack, the grub burrows into the PC’s flesh, working
  its way toward the heart in 1d4+2 rounds. Digging out the
  grub requires a DC 15 Agility check, causing 1 hp of damage
  per attempt. Barbers, surgeons, and other PCs with a medical
  background receive a +2 bonus to the check. If the grub isn’t
  removed in time, it burrows into the victim’s heart, resulting
  in instantaneous death.
  Rot Grub: Init (always last); Atk burrow +0 melee (special); 
  AC 10; hp 1; MV N/A; Act 1d20; SP burrow (causes instant
  death 1d4+2 rounds after successful attack); SV Fort +0, Ref -4, 
  Will +2; AL N.
  Persistent searchers discover a small alcove set in the floor, 
  hidden by piles of rotting hides. The alcove contains loose
  coins (53 sp, 23 gp, and 2 pp) and an elven short sword set
  with emeralds (worth 150 gp) wrapped in a simple green
  cloak. Sewn into the hem of the cloak is a treasure map inked
  on vellum and leading to the location of the judge’s choosing.
  Three torches, still flammable despite their age, are set in
  sconces on the wall.
  Finally, if an unlucky player has lost all his PCs in the course
  of the adventure, the judge can opt to allow the PCs to rescue
  villagers from their chains on the walls. Nursed back to
  consciousness, the unfortunate souls offer to join the party, becoming
  PCs under the players’ control. Regrettably (though
  perhaps mercifully), freed villagers can recall nothing of their
  ordeal after their capture. The player should roll up the 0-level
  PCs per the standard rules. At the judge’s discretion, up to six
  PCs can be added to the party from the captives hanging in
  the tower.
  If none of the players need replacement PCs, the freed captives
  are too weak and terrified to do anything other than flee back
  to their village. Regardless of how many captives are freed, 
  they are but a third of the total villagers kidnapped from the
  characters’ home.
  The Starless Sea
  General Features: Unless noted otherwise, the dungeon is
  dark and the air is cool and wet.
  Doors are unlocked but swollen with moisture and must be
  forced open. A door can be forced open in a single round with
  a DC 15 Strength check. Otherwise, battering down the door
  takes 1d4+1 rounds, alerting anyone (or anything) lurking beyond.
  Judges should note that there is little native light in the underworld.
  PCs can use the torches found in area H, the glowing
  skulls from area 1-2, or improvise their own light sources.
  Area 1-1 – Trail of Gold: You pause for an instant on the broad
  stone steps. The hint of gold glimmers at the edge of your light, several
  steps below.
  Closer inspection reveals the glimmer to be entirely mundane:
  three gold pieces forgotten on the gray stone step. The coins
  were dropped by the beastmen transporting the wealth of precious
  coins from area 1-1A to 1-5.
  The beastmen failed to fully close the vault’s secret door. The
  entrance to area 1-1A can be found with only a cursory inspection.
  However, PCs that don’t pause to search miss the
  entrance to area 1-1A.
  Area 1-1A – The Empty Vault: The narrow hall is lined with
  cut stone blocks. Dusty cobwebs hang from the low ceiling and time
  itself seems to weigh upon this ancient place. A trio of upended chests
  rest in the shadows in the rear of the chamber amid a scattering of
  coins. Tracks in the dust record the path of recent looters.
  This vault once held the amassed wealth of the chaos lords.
  Unfortunately, the beastmen have already transported the bulk
  of the wealth to area 1-5. All that remains are three chests and
  the spilled coins littering the floor (1d20 cp, 1d12 sp, 1d8 gp).
  While all of the chests are unlocked and emptied of wealth, the
  beastmen missed a secret compartment hidden in the base of
  the second chest.
  While the hidden compartment is easy to discover (the floor of
  the chest is 4 inches too high), opening the compartment poses
  a danger. The compartment can be opened by sliding a false
  panel in the back of the chest. Unless the PC also succeeds on
  a DC 15 Reflex save, the PC is struck by a slim, scything blade
  trap, inflicting 1d4 points of damage and slicing off 1d2 fingers.
  Hidden inside the compartment are two silver rings set with
  emeralds (worth 15 gp each), a silk tabard stitched with the sigil
  of Chaos (worth 5 gp) and a steel vial containing two doses
  of black lotus oil. Characters imbibing the lotus oil gain 1d10
  hp for 1 hour, but at the end of the hour lose any hp gained
  from the oil and must succeed on a DC 20 Fortitude save or
  take 1d4 points of damage.
  Area 1-2 – The Dread Hall: Wide stone steps descend into a
  long hall. The walls are decorated with elaborate tile mosaics depicting
  foul ceremonies to horrific and baleful fiends. The walls are slick
  with condensation and black algae. The condensation runs in rivulets
  and collects in a long, brackish pool set in the center of the hall.
  Have the PCs make a Luck check; on a DC 15 result, a character
  feels a strange compulsion to inspect the base of the
  Page 11
  pool, then pick up and carry off a skull once discovered (as
  described below).
  When the cult was young and strong, this chamber was used
  by acolytes to prepare their minds and souls for the awesome
  presence of the scions of Chaos. Now the chamber has fallen
  into disuse, scarcely noticed by the beastmen as they pass freely
  between the underworld and the sunlit lands above.
  Characters inspecting the mosaics discover three distinct
  scenes, as shown on the player handouts (see inside cover):
  • A hooded form standing atop a towering stone on the edge
  of a vast lake; seven tentacles wave from the water. This
  mosaic offers a clue as to the means of crossing the sea (area 1-4).
  • Two armored figures, holding a single flail, commanding
  legions of hunched, beast-like warriors. This mosaic depicts
  the brothers Molan and Felan, prior to their defeat by the armies
  of Law.
  • A low island set in the center of a black lake. A golden
  pyramid is set atop the island, and a figure armed with
  a flail is preparing to sacrifice a maiden. This hints to the
  nature of the chaos lord and the fate of the kidnapped villagers.
  A casual inspection of the chamber reveals four nooks concealed
  in the corners of the hall. Each nook contains a single
  hooded robe, embroidered with bizarre sigils stitched in silver
  thread. While the robes are mold-eaten and rotten to the touch, 
  they can still be worn as disguises in dim light. The beastmen
  retain a subconscious memory of the sacred order of Chaos, 
  and, unless provoked, will not attack anyone wearing a robe.
  Of course, if a PC wearing a robe does attack a beastman or
  chaos beast, any pretense is immediately ruined.
  The fetid pool set in the center of the chamber is thick with
  black algae and natural slime. Narrow in relation to its length, 
  the pool is 20 feet deep, and its base is lined with hundreds of
  skulls.
  If a character peers into the pool, a skull rises to the surface, a
  faint glow emanating from its eye sockets. The skulls are the
  last remnants of challengers that sought to dethrone the chaos
  lords and still hold a spark of their former spirit, bearing an
  unholy hatred for the brothers Felan and Molan.
  The skulls can be lifted from the murky water and glow brighter
  the closer they are brought to area 1-5. Though the skulls
  and their infernal spirits are not lawful-aligned by any means, 
  their hatred can aid the characters in their battle against the
  chaos lord (see area 1-5A).
  If the PCs are brazen enough to enter the pool and dig through
  the mounds of skulls, they discover a simple bronze ring, 
  roughly 12 inches in diameter, set into the floor of the pool.
  Rotating the ring 90 degrees causes the floor of the pool to
  fall away, taking the brackish water, the skulls, and the unfortunate
  soul that released the valve along with it. The PC
  is sucked down a narrow tube, slick with algae, into area 1-3.
  A character sucked down the tube must succeed on a DC 15
  Fortitude save or take 1d4 damage as he crashes into area 1-3.
  Those descending the tube by normal means can climb down
  to the pool below without risk.
  Area 1-3 – The Hidden Pool: The inky cave is nearly submerged
  with water, the slick ceiling dripping with black algae. Stalactites
  hang to the dark water’s surface, obscuring the far side of the
  cavern. Half-submerged along the banks of the pool, skulls leer at you
  through empty eye sockets. The chamber is as still as a tomb, save for
  the slow drip of water and slime from above.
  The chamber’s ceiling is a mere 4 feet above the floor and only
  2 feet above the water’s surface. The water runs in a trickle
  out the far side of the chamber, down through the rubble, and
  finally empties into the underground sea (area 1-4).
  The chamber can be discovered by opening the valve in area 1-2
  or by inquisitive PCs exploring the rocky slope above area 1-4.
  The floor of the pool is covered in a slurry of bones and mineral-
  heavy silt from above. Lucky searchers (DC 12 Intelligence
  or a DC 12 Luck check) may discover a plain iron ring set with
  three small rubies on a finger bone. When held in total darkness, 
  the rubies pulse like faint embers. This seemingly simple
  ring is actually the band of fire, an arcanist antiquity belonging
  to the enigmatic wizard Sezrakan. When worn by low-level
  characters, the band has the following powers:
  • The wearer may attempt to cast magic missile thrice per day.
  • The wearer may attempt to cast magic shield twice per day.
  • The wearer may attempt to cast scorching ray once per day.
  • Finally, when worn by a wizard, the ring grants a +1 bonus
  to all spell checks. A natural 1 still results in failure and possibly
  worse.
  Page 12
  Non-wizards attempting to harness the powers of the band
  make spell checks at 1d20 + class level, but do not add their
  Personality or Intelligence modifiers. Penalties for bulky armor
  still apply. Wizards using the band of fire make their spell
  checks per the core rules.
  Note that while non-wizards may attempt to use the first three
  powers, they are also subject to any corruption or misfires resulting
  from failed spell checks. At the judge’s discretion, the
  band may grant additional powers to powerful wizards (5th
  level and above).
  This is a powerful magic item. If other adventurers hear of the
  PCs’ possession of it, they can expect to be challenged.
  Area 1-4 – The Starless Sea: The wide stone steps run down
  to the dark-sand beach of a vast underground sea. Far out across
  the water, you can make out a golden glow through the gloom. An
  enormous menhir stands at the water’s edge, dark waves lapping at
  its intricately carved faces.
  Past the towering standing stone, a dragon-prowed longship emerges
  from the darkness, its hull scrawled with forbidding sigils and
  runes that glow a sickly green in the dim light. The ship draws to a
  stop some 50 feet offshore.
  The beat of distant drums and far-off wails of terror mixes with the
  quiet lapping of the waves.
  A quick inspection confirms the beach is churned by hundreds
  of bestial feet, talons, and hooves. Characters pausing
  to search carefully also discover a single trail of human footprints—
  tracks left by their fellow villagers chained together—
  and 1d6 silver coins.
  The Starless Sea presents two puzzles to the characters, one
  apparent and one hidden. The first: how best to board the enchanted
  ship. The second: how to avoid the wrath of the chaos
  leviathan lurking beneath the waves of the wine-dark sea.
  The menhir is carved with mesmerizing spirals that are almost
  impossible to trace. Characters that attempt to trace or decipher
  the carvings are struck by the overwhelming urge to sacrifice
  their fellows to the leviathan lurking beneath the waves.
  The PC must succeed on a DC 15 Will save or attack his nearest
  fellow with the intent of offering his victim’s still-beating
  heart to the leviathan. The geased PC can attempt to shrug off
  the compulsion once per round; having made a successful Will
  save, the PC cannot be compelled by the menhir again.
  A narrow series of steps wind up the surface of the menhir.
  Those climbing to the peak of the standing stone discover
  that the top of the stone has been fashioned into a platform. A
  shallow bowl has been cut into the center of the platform. The
  bowl is partially filled with hardened wax, and the stub of a
  red candle sits atop the mounds of wax.
  The Dragon Ship: Boarding the enchanted ship can be as
  simple as the PCs swimming out into the sea and clambering
  aboard the ship. This inevitably draws the wrath of the
  leviathan: a tentacle slithers after the first swimmer that climbs
  aboard. See below for details on the battle sure to follow.
  Relighting the candle—or lighting a new candle—atop the
  menhir draws the enchanted ship to shore, allowing characters
  to board in safety.
  Once all the PCs have boarded, the ship sets course for the
  island temple at the heart of the sea (area 1-5). However, halfway
  through the journey, the PCs must deal with the leviathan
  (see below).
  The ship can also be drawn to shore by lighting the censer
  (found in area E).
  The dragon ship is equipped with oars and, failing magic, can
  be rowed to the island (area 1-5).
  Treating with the Leviathan: Upon discovering the underground
  sea, the original chaos lords struck a pact with the fell
  beast, and their contract holds to this day. Crossing the underground
  sea requires successfully dealing with the leviathan
  lurking in the watery depths. As soon as the enchanted dragon
  ship crosses halfway to the island, the leviathan’s tentacles
  emerge from the black waters. Unless the PCs succeed in placating
  the leviathan within 5 rounds, two great tentacles wrap
  about the stern, arresting the ships progress across the sea. The
  following round, the leviathan attacks the fools that would
  dare to cross its domain without offering the required tribute.
  Pressed for time, the PCs are certain to come up with innovative
  and wild solutions to their dilemma. However the PCs
  attempt to treat with the leviathan, the judge is encouraged to
  entertain clever solutions and punish foolish ones. Following
  are some guidelines and indications to help the judge adjudicate
  the encounter:
  • Burning incense in the censer dedicated to the forces of
  Chaos (found in area E) stills the great tentacles. The leviathan
  acknowledges its age-old pact, placing its tentacles at
  the feet of the summoner, before sliding back beneath the
  waves.
  • Sacrificing one or more creatures to the leviathan (as depicted
  in area 1-2) appeases the leviathan but sorely offends
  any gods of Law. Characters taking this route damn
  themselves to the service of wicked gods, or worse, to the
  absence of any patron whatsoever. Alternately, PCs sacrificing
  more than 500 gp worth of goods (pouring them
  into the waves) can placate the chaos beast without offending
  the patrons of Law.
  • False Sacrifice: PCs may attempt to distract the beast by
  “chumming” the water with corpses or blood. Depending
  on the sophistication of the ruse, this can buy the PCs
  time. In this case, the furious leviathan seizes the boat as it
  draws within 50 feet of the island-temple’s shore.
  • Battle the Leviathan: while battling the chaos beast is certainly
  direct, it likely ends in the destruction of the party, 
  or at the very least the death of those unlucky enough to
  come within reach of the beast’s 75-foot-long tentacles.
  The only hope of those electing to attack the beast lies in a
  critical hit; otherwise, their doom is nearly certain.
  In battle, the leviathan first pulls PCs into the sea, then tears
  them limb from limb. On a successful attack, the leviathan can
  opt to forgo inflicting damage and instead loop around the PC’s
  limbs or waist. The following round, the PC must succeed on a
  Strength check (DC 20) or be drawn into the dark waters.
  Note that the leviathan’s body never surfaces and only tentacles
  emerge dripping from the water. Characters diving
  beneath the waves to take the battle directly to the leviathan
  Page 13
  discover an enormous beast covered by thousands of thickly
  hooded eyes and slack jaws—the horrified, tortured faces of
  all its previous victims.
  Dealing 66 hp of damage to the leviathan does not slay the
  mighty creature. Rather, the beast withdraws from the battle, 
  propelling itself deep beneath the waves. Any PCs still caught
  within its tentacles are permitted one last Strength check (DC

20. to wrest free of the leviathan’s mighty grip. Those that fail
    are drawn beneath the waves and never seen again—except
    perhaps as terrified, slack-jawed faces embedded into the leviathan’s
    gibbering hide.
    Chaos Leviathan: Init +0; Atk tentacle +6 melee (1d8+2); AC
    15; HD 10d10; HP 66; MV 50’; Act 6d20; SP grapple on successful
    hit (Str DC 20 to escape); SV Fort +10, Ref -2, Will +6; AL C.
    Area 1-5 – Temple of Chaos: The island draws closer, revealing
    the source of the golden glow: a towering ziggurat, with burning
    light radiating from within the sliver-thin cracks between its massive
    stone blocks.
    A wide ramp circles the edifice, sloping to the top of the temple.
    Hordes of beastmen crowd the ramp, howling to the darkness, hammering
    on massive hide drums and pushing a terrified string of
    prisoners to the ziggurat’s glowing peak. High atop the temple, you
    can make out a fearsome silhouette of an enormous armored figure,
    wreathed in infernal smoke lit from below.
    The ziggurat serves as a mystical forge designed for a single
    purpose: reuniting the spirit of the chaos lord with a physical
    body. The beastmen are driving the kidnapped villagers
    up the ziggurat to be slaughtered, their bodies pitched into
    the molten heart of the ziggurat along with a king’s ransom in
    gold, silver, and copper. A beastman shaman reigns over the
    ceremony, hoisting an effigy of the chaos lord high into the
    smoke. While the effigy cannot fool PCs reaching the uppermost
    level of the ziggurat, it is sufficient to deceive characters
    peering up from below.
    PCs disguised as chaos priests (with the robes from area 1-2)
    or as beastmen (with the hides and furs from area H) can pass
    through the throngs of beastmen with little difficulty. The
    judge should call for Personality checks to maintain the tension,
    but the beastmen are lost in religious fervor and not expecting
    infiltrators within their midst. Of course, if the PCs
    attack either the beastmen or the mock chaos lord, the con is
    instantly detected.
    If the characters haven’t adopted a ruse, gaining the peak of
    the ziggurat is more difficult. The beastmen do not immediately
    notice the PCs’ arrival; if the PCs sneak and climb along
    beneath the ramp, there is a slim chance they can draw close
    to the peak of the ziggurat before being discovered. The lead
    PC must make a series of Agility checks with increasing difficulty
    to avoid notice as the party climbs higher up the temple.
    Circling the first level requires a DC 10 Agility check; circling
    the second, a DC 15 check; ascending the third level, DC 20.
    Climbing from the third level to the peak of the ziggurat immediately
    alerts the beastmen to the characters’ presence, but
    the PCs gain a free surprise round. (Thieves can use their skills
    in place of an Agility check.)
    Finally, if the PCs opt to attack the beastmen from the onset
    and take the temple by storm, they will pay the price in blood.
    Again, the PCs are granted a free surprise round before the
    beastmen turn their full might on the audacious characters.
    There are 22 beastmen crowded onto the ramp, with another
    3 acolytes atop the ziggurat attending the beastman shaman.
    Beastmen (22): Init +1; Atk spear +0 melee (1d6); AC 12; HD
    1d8; hp 3 each; MV 30’; Act 1d20; SV Fort +1, Ref +1, Will -1;
    AL C.
    Area 1-5A – Atop the Temple: PCs reaching the peak of the
    ziggurat discover a horrifying scene:
    The peak of the temple is dominated by a vast, smoking pit that glows
    with a hellish light. A mighty beastman hoists an effigy of a fearsome
    armored figure high into the swirling clouds as the prisoners are
    hurled screaming, one after another, into the pit. A trio of snarling
    beastmen upends woven baskets, pouring thousands of coins in after
    your fellow villagers, producing gouts of hissing smoke and flame!
    All about you is the thundering cacophony of drums and bestial
    howls as the bizarre ritual nears its climax!
    However the PCs decide to reveal themselves, the beastmen
    swarm towards the PCs while the shaman and his acolytes do
    their best to finish the ritual. The beastmen on the ramp do
    not fight to kill, but rather try to seize the PCs, bear them to
    the pit, and hurl the characters into the sacrificial flames. A PC
    is seized on a successful attack and must succeed on a DC 15
    Strength check or be borne 15 feet up the ramp towards the pit.
    Adjacent beastmen making successful attacks on the same PC
    increase the difficulty of the Strength check by +2 per attack.
    On the PC’s own turn, he can do nothing but attempt to escape
    the grapple with another Strength check.
    Characters carried this way to the pit are hurled into the flames
    and permitted one final save (Reflex DC 20) to catch hold of
    the edge of the pit. Anyone failing this check plunges to his
    death in the magma below.
    Unlike their fellows, the shaman and his acolytes understand
    the gravity of the PCs’ presence and fight to kill. If the PCs
    reach the peak of the ziggurat, the shaman howls to the darkness
    above and pitches the chaos lord’s effigy into the pit. This
    immediately extinguishes the flames and plunges the cavern
    into darkness. The only light remaining is the hellish glow
    emanating from the pit.
    Characters with a view of the pit see the sacrificial bodies and
    coins consumed by a pool of unholy magma. The effigy bursts
    into flame, magically drawing in the flesh and gold-steeped
    magma. Animated by the spirit of the chaos lord, the glowing
    effigy emerges from the magma, rapidly cooling into a hardened,
    blackened form. One round later, the rock crust shatters,
    revealing the fully-armored body of the chaos lord: a hellish,
    horned humanoid, with a single, cyclopean eye that blazes
    with infernal light. Molan emerges from his unholy forge and
    strides into battle, hammering down foes with his triple-headed
    spiked flail. The skull-faced chaos lord eagerly fights to the
    death, madly reveling in the destruction of life.
    Any skulls brought from the pool in area 1-2 flare bright with
    hatred. The skulls can be hurled at the chaos lord (Agility
    check, DC 10 to hit); the skulls shatter on impact, erupting in
    flame and causing 1d6+1 damage to the chaos lord. Any immediately-
    adjacent targets take half damage (Reflex save, DC
    12 to avoid taking damage altogether).
    Page 14
    The Destruction of the Chaos Lord: Upon taking 20 hp of
    damage, the body of the chaos lord dissolves back into magma,
    the chaos lord’s spirit unable to sustain its hold on its physical
    form. The flail and the demon armor fall to the ground, the
    sole remnants of their fallen master.
    If the PCs take up either the flail or the armor within 5 rounds,
    the magma surges back to life with unholy fury, forming a
    pillar of flaming brilliance. The magma lashes out at any PC
    within 10’ (Atk +2 melee; dmg 1d4+3). But even the chaos
    lord’s hatred cannot sustain this form for long: regardless of
    whether the PCs deal it damage or not, the pillar collapses
    back into formlessness on the third round, never to rise again.
    This true death of the chaos lord triggers the destruction of
    his temple and cavern. A low rumble rolls through the cavern,
    building to a deafening roar. Massive stone slabs peel away
    from the cavern’s ceiling and fall into the sea. Waves crash
    up the sides of the ziggurat, even as sizzling magma seeps
    through the seams in the stone blocks. It should be apparent
    to the PCs that their time atop the chaos lord’s temple is drawing
    to a close. The PCs have only 1d6+2 actions to escape to
    the dragon ship before the western cavern collapses, driving
    a towering wall of water 30 feet over the top of the ziggurat.
    The judge should not warn the players about
    their characters’
    impending doom. Rather, the judge should make the roll in secret,
    describe the cataclysmic acts taking place within the cavern,
    and ask the players to describe their PCs’ actions. Reaching
    the ship and climbing aboard requires 2 actions.
    When the roaring wave engulfs the ziggurat, those aboard the
    ship are swept towards area 1-6, and all others perish amid the
    dark waters. Characters that fail to reach the ship in time can
    attempt a final DC 17 Luck check to pull themselves aboard.
    Favor from the Gods: The characters’ patrons look on with
    favor as the chaos lord is destroyed. Characters worshipping
    good or lawful deities, or those with supernatural patrons who
    would be opposed to the reign of Chaos, receive a permanent
    +1 bonus to Luck when the chaos lord is destroyed.
    Treasure: A king’s ransom of gold and silver is consumed in
    the chaos lord’s rite, but not all the wealth is lost; ample coinage
    remains scattered about the top ziggurat. A PC can sweep
    up 1d20 gp and 2d20 sp per action.
    Finally, there remains the arms and armor of the chaos lord
    himself. Topped with blackened iron and ringed with spikes,
    the chaos lord’s spiked flail is a weapon of great power. In addition
    to being +1 to both hit and damage, once per day the
    wielder of the spiked flail can wreathe the weapon in flames for
    3 rounds, inflicting an additional 1d6 points of damage on a
    successful strike.
    The chaos lord’s armor is plate mail forged of blackened iron.
    While it has no magical properties, its superior construction
    grants its wearer a Fortitude save (DC 20) against the effects
    of critical hits.
    Taking up either the spiked flail or the armor requires an action.
    Chaos Lord Animated Effigy: Init +0; Atk flail +6 melee

    Area 1-6 – Into the Unknown: The towering wave propels
    you with terrifying speed towards the distant carven wall! Ahead,
    through a sea of towering whitecaps and the debris of falling boulders
    you spy the mouth of a narrow cave! The dragon-prowed ship rides
    down the crest of the giant wave and shoots into the rocky maw, the
    howling surf crashing all around you!
    The ending of the adventure (and the start of the next) is entirely
    up to the judge. Area 1-6 can open into an above-ground
    river, seated deep in the base of a ravine, or plunge the PCs
    deeper beneath the surface of the earth. The former allows
    the PCs to return to their home village, lick their wounds, and
    consider their next quest. The latter plunges the PCs into another
    adventure before their first has scarcely ended.
    Whatever the judge’s whim, XP and Luck should be awarded
    prior to the beginning of the next adventure, for—be it by luck
    or skill—surviving PCs have surely earned their just rewards.
