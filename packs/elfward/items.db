{"name":"Arcane Affinity","permission":{"default":0,"U5X07uKi3FMVWkQ1":3,"PglDtF7cBy19gpOi":3},"type":"spell","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>Some wizards choose to specialize in a particular kind of magic. They may be necromancers who study the lore of un-dead or pyromancers who control fire. They may be elementalists who can control free-willed elementals or summoners who bring material objects into existence from nowhere. These specialist mages go beyond the capabilities of normal magic-users by studying, pondering, and ultimately completely connecting to the school of arcane magic they choose. A necromancer may live with un-dead</p>\n<p>creatures to fully understand them. A pyromancer may dwell in a volcano. An elementalist may live on one of the four elemental planes, and a conjurer may study the atomic building blocks of matter.</p>\n<p>This spell is the mechanism by which specialty magic happens. This spell forms an affinity between the caster and one kind of magic. This affinity comes after much time and labor is expended and has a cost:</p>\n<p>the spell slot is forever occupied by this very spell, and the caster is forever connected to the arcane element he chooses. However, this spell also has a benefit: it makes the caster more powerful in a specific school of magic.</p>\n<p>Although this spell is listed in the caster&rsquo;s spellbook as the spell arcane affinity, it is really a different spell depending on each caster&rsquo;s goal. It truly represents the time and effort necessary to develop an affinity for a particular school of magic. The &ldquo;casting time&rdquo; is a set of rituals and actions necessary to form the affinity. This is a level 2 spell because a caster must understand the basic principles of magic before he can build an affinity. Traditional affinities and their &ldquo;casting time&rdquo; are as follows. Note the &ldquo;casting time&rdquo; can, in game terms, be considered to overlap with adventuring time or be a lull between adventures.</p>\n<p>&bull; Illusionist: A specialist in spells that alter perceptions or create false images and sounds. An illusionist must spend at least one year understanding how the human body processes sensory input and how it can be fooled.</p>\n<p>&bull; Summoner: A specialist in spells that summon animals, monsters, and other creatures to aid the caster, including elementals and demons. A summoner may further specialize in a particular kind of creatures summoned (e.g., elementals). Summoners may also specialize in summoning objects as well as creatures. A summoner must spend at least one year studying the creatures he wants to summon, both in captivity and in their natural surroundings.</p>\n<p>&bull; Necromancer: A specialist in the un-dead, their creation, their control, and their limits. A necromancer may ultimately pursue eternal life via his own transformation into an un-dead. A necromancer must spend at least one year in the presence of un-dead.</p>\n<p>&bull; Transmuter: A specialist in changing matter from one form to another, whether it be flesh to stone, iron to gold, or something in between. A transmuter must spend at least one year in a laboratory studying the properties of different materials.</p>\n<p>&bull; Pyromancer: A specialist in the study of fire. Pyromancers must spend at least one year in the presence of great flames, such as an active volcano or on the plane of fire. Pyromancers ultimately learn to create, control, and destroy flames at will. There are other specialists who study similar magical powers but control other elements; e.g., fulminators who study electricity, cryomancers who study cold, and aerialists who study air.</p>\n<p>&bull; Demonologist: A specialist in the summoning, control, exorcism, destruction, and lore of demons. This is a dangerous specialty, for demons are never willing to divulge the information necessary to control them. A demonologist must spend at least three years studying ancient tomes, consulting supernatural spirits, and traveling to distant planes to learn what he needs to control demons.</p>\n<p>After a specialist has committed the necessary &ldquo;casting time&rdquo; to specialize in one field, a spell check is made. The spell check determines the benefit of specialization, as noted below. Many specialists utilize spellburn at this point to ensure a good result. Some specialists may attempt ritualized versions of this spell by casting it in a place of power, in concert with other mages, or with an appropriate sacrifice. The ritual rules at the beginning of this chapter, combined with the judge&rsquo;s discretion, determine the nature of the ritual.</p>\n<p>The caster may choose to specialize in more than one field, provided he obeys the dictates given here and in the spell results. Because specialization typically results in improved spellcasting in certain spells and reduced spellcasting in others, a wizard with multiple specialties may find they begin to offset each other.</p><br><p><strong>Spell Data:</strong> @Compendium[dcc-core-book.dcc-core-spell-journals.Arcane Affinity]{Arcane Affinity}</p>","chat":"","unidentified":"","summary":""},"source":"","config":{"inheritActionDie":true,"inheritSpellCheck":true,"castingMode":"wizard"},"available":true,"level":2,"range":"Self","duration":"Varies","page":"162","castingTime":"Varies","results":{"table":"Arcane Affinity","collection":"dcc-core-book.dcc-core-spell-tables-wizard"},"save":"N/A","spellCheck":{"die":"1d20","value":0},"mercurialEffect":{"value":null,"summary":"","description":""}},"folder":"tvlj7Ln9GRjy4ddv","sort":100001,"flags":{},"img":"modules/dcc-core-book/assets/svg/game-icons-net/abstract-085.svg","effects":[],"_id":"AZZ80hsxYD26w7HB"}

This patron may be a demon, devil, ghost, spirit, elemental, angel, chaos lord, or other supernatural being who accepts the caster&rsquo;s service. The</p>\n<p>initial ceremony takes one week to complete. Once the pact is made, the caster may invoke the patron&rsquo;s support with the spell invoke patron, and it may or may not answer as it sees fit. In return for the patron&rsquo;s assistance, it may ask the caster to do certain things. The caster must act faithfully in its service at all times, lest it cast him off. The caster may perform more than one ceremony to serve multiple masters, but doing so may raise questions as to his true loyalties. This is dangerous magic; a supernatural patron is not the same as the deity that a cleric may worship. The caster should be forewarned that he is in communion with almighty spirits.</p>\n<p>Alternately, once the caster has formed a bond with his patron, this spell may be cast to create a bond between another mortal and the caster&rsquo;s patron. The mortal need not be a spellcaster; in fact, the second mortal usually is not. In this case, both the caster and the recipient must spend a week on the ceremony, which requires a mighty oath to declare allegiance to the patron. Very powerful creatures are more likely to successfully bond with patrons (who look more favorably upon powerful followers). Typically, a casting of patron bond on behalf of another receives a bonus of +2 if the subject is of 5th-level (5 HD) or higher and +4 if the subject is of 9th-level (9 HD) or higher. At the end of the ceremony, the casting of the spell seals the bond.

In return for the patron&rsquo;s assistance, it may ask the caster to do certain things. The caster must act faithfully in its service at all times, lest it cast him off. The caster may perform more than one ceremony to serve multiple masters, but doing so may raise questions as to his true loyalties. This is dangerous magic; a supernatural patron is not the same as the deity that a cleric may worship. The caster should be forewarned that he is in communion with almighty spirits.</p>\n<p>Alternately, once the caster has formed a bond with his patron, this spell may be cast to create a bond between another mortal and the caster&rsquo;s patron. The mortal need not be a spellcaster; in fact, the second mortal usually is not. In this case, both the caster and the recipient must spend a week on the ceremony, which requires a mighty oath to declare allegiance to the patron. Very powerful creatures are more likely to successfully bond with patrons (who look more favorably upon powerful followers). Typically, a casting of patron bond on behalf of another receives a bonus of +2 if the subject is of 5th-level (5 HD) or higher and +4 if the subject is of 9th-level (9 HD) or higher.

Using restore vitality to offset spellburn will inevitably create trouble for the cleric, whose deity surely does not appreciate his power being used to heal wounds deliberately created to further the ends of another supernatural creature!</p><br><p><strong>Spell Data:</strong> @Compendium[dcc-core-book.dcc-core-spell-journals.Restore Vitality]{Restore Vitality}</p>","chat":"","unidentified":"","summary":""},"source":"","config":{"inheritActionDie":true,"inheritSpellCheck":true,"castingMode":"wizard"},"available":true,"level":2,"range":"Touch or further","duration":"Permanent","page":"278","castingTime":"1 turn","results":{"table":"Restore Vitality","collection":"dcc-core-book.dcc-core-spell-tables-cleric"},"save":"N/A","spellCheck":{"die":"1d20","value":0},"mercurialEffect":{"value":null,"summary":"","description":""}},"folder":"MhY5NCw69YW4FaZz","sort":800001,"flags":{},"img":"modules/dcc-core-book/assets/svg/game-icons-net/stump-regrowth.svg","effects":[],"_id":"etVWWTWYMUtuCEqA"}

This patron may be a demon, devil, ghost, spirit, elemental, angel, chaos lord, or other supernatural being who accepts the caster&rsquo;s service.

Once the pact is made, the caster may invoke the patron&rsquo;s support with the spell invoke patron, and it may or may not answer as it sees fit. In return for the patron&rsquo;s assistance, it may ask the caster to do certain things. The caster must act faithfully in its service at all times, lest it cast him off. The caster may perform more than one ceremony to serve multiple masters, but doing so may raise questions as to his true loyalties. This is dangerous magic; a supernatural patron is not the same as the deity that a cleric may worship. The caster should be forewarned that he is in communion with almighty spirits.</p>\n<p>Alternately, once the caster has formed a bond with his patron, this spell may be cast to create a bond between another mortal and the caster&rsquo;s patron. The mortal need not be a spellcaster; in fact, the second mortal usually is not. In this case, both the caster and the recipient must spend a week on the ceremony, which requires a mighty oath to declare allegiance to the patron. Very powerful creatures are more likely to successfully bond with patrons (who look more favorably upon powerful followers). Typically, a casting of patron bond on behalf of another receives a bonus of +2 if the subject is of 5th-level (5 HD) or higher and +4 if the subject is of 9th-level (9 HD) or higher.

{"name":"Stinging Stone","permission":{"default":0,"U5X07uKi3FMVWkQ1":3,"PglDtF7cBy19gpOi":3},"type":"spell","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>The cleric transforms an object into a poisonous creature. For example, the cleric can change a sling stone into a spider, an arrow to an asp, or a staff into a serpent. The specifics are as follows:</p>\n<p>&bull; At low levels of effect (see below), the cleric can transform a small object into a poisonous spider. The object can be a coin, gem, sling stone, apple, beer mug, or other such small thing. The spell descriptions below assume a sling stone is used. For the spell&rsquo;s duration, the object retains its natural shape until it touches an enemy. So, for example, the cleric can hide a gemstone in a chest, which transforms into a spider when grasped; or launch an attack with his sling, and the stone transforms into a spider or scorpion when it strikes the enemy. Once the object touches an enemy (either through their grasp or via a successful hit as with a sling stone), it transforms into a spider, which remains for a certain amount of time. The spider receives one bite immediately on the round of attack and one additional bite each round until the spell ends. (A missed sling stone does not transform.) It reverts to its natural shape at the end of the spell. The poisonous spider is AC 14 (due to small size and agility) and has only 1 hp, but immediately scurries toward exposed flesh and strikes the enemy. On the first bite, the spider&rsquo;s attack automatically hits, causing damage 1 + poison. The target must make a Fort save against the spell check DC or suffer poison as per a (roll [[/roll 1d3]]) (1) black widow; (2) tarantula; or (3) scorpion (see Appendix P). On future rounds the spider must make an attack roll at Atk +2 in order to inflict damage. Note that the spider continues to scurry about and bite for the duration of the spell. Strikes against it that miss have a 50% chance of hitting the spell&rsquo;s target for damage.</p>\n<p>&bull;At medium levels of effect (see below), the cleric can transform an arrow into an asp or adder. (He could also transform other similarly shaped objects into an asp or adder: a stick of wood, a lever, a metal rod, etc.) As above, the object retains its natural shape until it touches an enemy, at which point it transforms. The asp or adder receives one bite immediately on the round of attack and one additional bite each round until the spell ends. The first bite automatically hits, causing damage 2 +</p>\n<p>poison. The target must make a Fort save against the spell check DC or suffer the poison of an asp or adder (see Appendix P). On future rounds the snake must make an attack roll at Atk +4 in order to inflict damage. Note that the snake continues to slither about and bite for the duration of the spell. Strikes against it that miss have a 50% chance of hitting the spell&rsquo;s target for damage.</p>\n<p>&bull; At the highest levels of effect (see below), the cleric can transform a staff into a cobra or viper. (He could also transform other similarly shaped objects into a cobra: a tree branch, a pole arm, etc.) In this case, each time the cleric strikes with the staff, it transforms into a serpent, bites, and then transforms back into a staff. The serpent-staff is treated as a +4 magical weapon, so it attacks at the cleric&rsquo;s normal attack bonus with an additional +4 modifier. Any successful attack causes normal weapon damage, +4 for the magical modifier, and inflicts poison as per a cobra or viper strike (see Appendix P). The Fort save against the poison is the spell check result. If the cleric strikes with the staff and then releases it, the staff remains in serpent form and continues to attack with its bite for the duration of the spell; in this case, it attacks at Atk +6 and inflicts damage of [[/roll 1d4+4]] plus poison.</p>\n<p>In all cases, the transformed spider or serpent is wild and uncontrolled. It will not obey commands from the cleric. An arrow that transforms into an asp, for example, cannot be commanded to return to the cleric after killing its target. It will simply slither off like any wild snake.</p><br><p><strong>Spell Data:</strong> @Compendium[dcc-core-book.dcc-core-spell-journals.Stinging Stone]{Stinging Stone}</p>","chat":"","unidentified":"","summary":""},"source":"","config":{"inheritActionDie":true,"inheritSpellCheck":true,"castingMode":"wizard"},"available":true,"level":2,"range":"Objects touched","duration":"See below","page":"282","castingTime":"1 turn","results":{"table":"Stinging Stone","collection":"dcc-core-book.dcc-core-spell-tables-cleric"},"save":"Fort vs. spell check DC","spellCheck":{"die":"1d20","value":0},"mercurialEffect":{"value":null,"summary":"","description":""}},"folder":"MhY5NCw69YW4FaZz","sort":1000001,"flags":{},"img":"modules/dcc-core-book/assets/svg/game-icons-net/hydra-shot.svg","effects":[],"_id":"kGoOpLSHojxLnW4N"}
