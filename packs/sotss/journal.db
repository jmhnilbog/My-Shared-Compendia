Now the ruins seem host only to creeping vines and the foul miasma that drifts down from the keep.\n\nThe **air is overrun with pestilence**. Fat flies bite at you incessantly, and **clouds of small black insects** choke your every breath. The long-abandoned land is **choked with thorny vines** that drape the **sickly trees** and hang from the **ruined walls**. There is an **odor of rot and decay**, as if the hill itself were decomposing from within.\n\nA sight gives you pause: **a ragged banner, depicting a crimson skull on a black field**, stands high atop the ruined walls. Whatever lurks within has terrorized you and your village for far too long.\n\nYou turn to your companions and ready your meager weapons. The time for retribution has come.\n\n:::\n\n## Features {.features}\n\n::: features\n\n- The keep’s **walls rise 30 feet from their rammed earth embankments**. See below for climbing details.\n- The walls and all the fallen stones are **covered in a patchwork of moss, sickly vines, and lichen**.\n- Rather than simple carved blocks, the keep seems to have been **built of enormous standing stones and mighty dolmens**. The blocks are fitted together crudely, leaving **cracks between the stones** for rotting vegetation and pools of water that act as host to the **gnats and mosquitoes**.\n\n:::\n\n## Points of Interest\n\n\n\n## Entering the Keep\n\nThe PCs are free to enter as they see fit.\n\n- While the **most obvious approach takes them up the @JournalEntry[Devil's Causeway]**, this is also the most dangerous. Wily characters will be rewarded for their suspicion, though hesitation should never be mistaken for caution.\n- **Approaching from the west** requires the characters to ascend the @JournalEntry[Ruined Wall]. Picking their way through the fallen blocks is not difficult, but carries its own risks.\n- **Approaching from northeast** brings the PCs directly to the @JournalEntry[Sinkhole].\n- Characters **attempting to ascend walls** face a difficult climb. Each character attempting to scale the walls must succeed on a ***DC 15 climb check*** or fall 20 feet ***for 2d6 damage*** before tumbling down to the base of the rammed earth mound. Remember that falls also include a **chance of broken bones**; each ***6*** rolled adds a broken bone and permanent loss of ***1 Strength or Agility*** as described in @Compendium[dcc-core-book.dcc-core-text.MNAG6rNKx8YEo1ry]{Chapter 4: Combat}.\n\n:::\n\n## Triggers\n\n::: triggers\n\nBy Day {.day}\n: The keep betrays no obvious signs of patrols.\n\nAt Dusk {.dusk}\n: Two beastmen (from above the @JournalEntry[Gatehouse]) light torches on the ruined battlements.\n\tThe glow of the @JournalEntry[Sinkhole] becomes more obvious.\n\t\nAt Night {.night}\n: Torches and the @JournalEntry[Sinkhole] throw weird shadows. Glimpses of the beastmen above the @JournalEntry[Gatehouse] may be seen. The beastmen within the @JournalEntry[Tower of the Beast] patrol the Keep instead of waiting in place. They need no light.\n\nOutrageous behavior\n: If the beastmen just can't ignore what the PCs are doing, **all beastmen present within the scene attack** as near the @JournalEntry[Well of Souls] as possible, trying to hurl adventurers into the pit. **Such behavior increases the chance of random encounters by 1 for the duration of the adventure**.\n\nStakeout\n: Each hour of watching the keep gives a **1 in 3** chance of encountering a @Actor[Beastman] party of [[2d3]] at a distance of [[1d6*10]] feet.\n\nRandom Encounters\n: There is a base **1 in 10** chance of a random encounter every turn within the scene. @RollTable[The Ruined Keep Random Encounters].\n:::","img":"modules/sailors-on-the-starless-sea/assets/handouts/Scene-The-Ruined-Keep.png"}

A mighty beastman hoists an effigy of a fearsome armored figure high into the swirling clouds as the prisoners are hurled screaming, one after another, into the pit. A trio of snarling beastmen upends woven baskets, pouring thousands of coins in after your fellow villagers, producing gouts of hissing smoke and flame!

Note that each adjacent beastman hitting a PC with this attack increases the DC by +2. Allow two beastmen to crowd into a 5' square.\n: The @Actor[Beastman Shaman] and 3x @Actor[Beastman Acolyte] attack to kill. The Shaman remains within reach of the effigy.\n\nIf the party reaches the peak of the ziggurat\n: The @Actor[Beastman Shaman] howls to the darkness above and pitches the chaos lord's effigy into the pit. This immediately extinguishes the flames and @Macro[Plunges The Cavern Into Darkness].The  only  light  remaining  is  the  hellish  glow  emanating from the pit.\n\n    one round later...\n    : The effigy's lava crust shatters, revealing the fully-armored body of the chaos lord: a hellish, horned  humanoid,  with  a  single,  cyclopean  eye  that  blazes  with infernal light.  Molan emerges from his unholy forge and strides into battle, hammering down foes with his triple-headed spiked flail. The skull-faced chaos lord eagerly fights to the death, madly reveling in the destruction of life.\n    : Any @Item[Hate-Filled Skull] present flares with hatred. If thrown at @Actor[Molan], they hit on a DC 10 Agility check and explode, doing [[/roll 1d6+1]] damage to him. Adjacent characters take half damage if they fail a Reflex DC 12.\n\n        Molan's tokens are configured not to show health bars to the players. {.note}\n\n        If Molan takes 20 damage\n        : The body of the chaos lord dissolves back into magma, the chaos lord’s spirit unable to sustain its hold on its physical form. The flail and the demon armor fall to the ground, the sole remnants of their fallen master.\n        : Any living Beastman Acolytes or Shamen wail and hurl themselves into the magma.\n        : The other Beastmen flip out, attacking at random. There s only a 1 in 4 chance that any beastman will attack a character.\n        \n            if 5 rounds pass without the players taking up Molan's weapon or armor\n            : Molan is forever dead, triggering the @Macro[Destruction of the Cavern].\n\n            if a PC takes up the weapon or armor\n            : the magma surges back to life with unholy fury as @Macro[Molan Goes Geothermal], forming a @Actor[Magma Pillar] of flaming brilliance! It remains for three rounds before collapsing and triggering the @Macro[Destruction of the Cavern].\n\nIf anyone can see into the magma pit\n: Sacrificial bodies and coins are being consumed by a pool of unholy magma.\n    \n    and the effigy is within it\n    : The effigy bursts into flame, magically drawing in the flesh and gold-steeped magma. Animated by the spirit of the chaos lord, the glowing effigy emerges from the magma, rapidly cooling into a hardened, blackened form.\n\nIf anyone falls or is pushed into the magma pit {.trap}\n: Reflex DC 20 to catch the edge and clamber up, or fall into the magma. Players attempting other methods to avoid falling into the pit should be encouraged to \n: If a player suggests using another method to \n: Magma is freaking hot, and can suffocate whatever doesn't melt. It's magma.\n\nIf @Macro[Destruction of the Cavern] happens\n: A low rumble rolls through the cavern, building to a deafening roar. Massive stone slabs peel away from the cavern’s ceiling and fall into the sea. Waves crash up the sides of the ziggurat, even as sizzling magma seeps through  the  seams  in  the  stone  blocks.  It  should  be  apparent  to the PCs that their time atop the chaos lord’s temple is draw-ing to a close.\n: The PCs have only [[/roll 1d6+2]] actions to escape to the dragon ship before the western cavern collapses, driving a towering wall of water 30 feet over the top of the ziggurat. The judge should not warn the players about their characters’ impending doom. Rather, the judge should make the roll in se-cret, describe the cataclysmic acts taking place within the cav-ern, and ask the players to describe their PCs’ actions.\n\n    When the actions have elapsed\n    : A roaring wave engulfs the ziggurat, those aboard the ship are swept towards area 1-6, and all others perish amid the dark waters. \n    : Characters that fail to reach the ship in time can attempt a final DC 17 Luck check to pull themselves aboard.\n\n:::: rewards\nA king’s ransom of gold and silver is consumed in the chaos lord’s rite, but not all the wealth is lost; ample coin-age remains scattered about the top ziggurat. A PC can sweep up 1d20 gp and 2d20 sp per action.Finally, there remains the arms and armor of the chaos lord himself. Topped with blackened iron and ringed with spikes, the chaos lord’s spiked flail is a weapon of great power. In ad-dition  to  being  +1  to  both  hit  and  damage,  once  per  day  the  wielder of the spiked flail can wreathe the weapon in flames for 3 rounds, inflicting an additional 1d6 points of damage on a successful strike.The chaos lord’s armor is plate mail forged of blackened iron. While it has no magical properties, its superior construction grants its wearer a Fortitude save (DC 20) against the effects of critical hits.
